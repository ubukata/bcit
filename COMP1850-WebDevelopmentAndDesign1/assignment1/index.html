			<p>I am Vitor Ubukata and I am an Web Developer with a Bachelor in Information Systems from University of São Paulo in Brazil and currently I am persuing the Agile Development Certificate from BCIT in Vancouver in Canada.</p>
			<p>During my past 5 years I have been working with web development and using Agile techniques during the process of software development and I believe in the benefits that the agile can bring for the project.</p>
			<p>Some technical skills include ASP.NET, MVC, C#, DDD, SCRUM, Entity Framework, NHibernate, SQL Server 2008, Oracle 10g/11g, Java Script, jQuery, HTML, Git, Team Foundation Server, Phonegap, Cordova and much more.</p>
			<p>Currently I am studying HTML5 and CSS, Node.js and Angular.</p>
			<p>My next goal for my carrer is to work more with Agile in analysis and managament. I participated in some projects as a SCRUM Master but know with more knowledge and experience I believe can contributte even more in this role.</p>
			<p>One of my technical goals for the future is to study more about Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, during my University I had the opportunity to develop the Bayes Theorem to analyse 1 million of twitters and categorize than into good and bad twitters and them I realized how many analysis over data we can do with Artificial Intelligence.</p>

			<p>In my free time I enjoy going out for eat or drink something, I like trying new kinds of food and here in Vancouver is a great place to try new things.</p>
			<p>When I was used to live in Brazil I was going kart every month with some friends and I was really enjoying it but here I didn't have the opportunity to it yet. My another passion is to go fish, I used to go at least twice a month with my father or my friends, always trying new places, baits and techniques. My favourite fishing fish is the snook but apparently it is not a common fish here in Canada. I didn't go fishing here yet but I'm willing to try catching some salmons!</p>
			<p>I like technologies in general and I try to follow the new releases and trending that pop out in the Internet and I also enjoy play computer games like CSGO and Dota.</p>
			<p>During vacations I love travelling to new places and explore it walking around the city, visiting tourist points and going out at night to experience the most of the city.</p>
			<p>If you like my profile and experience or want to discuss about new opportunities and projects please fell free to contact me. All my contacts are in the bottom of the pages. Hope to hear of you soon!</p>
