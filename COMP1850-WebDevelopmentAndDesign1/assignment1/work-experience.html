		<p>It is a medium size company engaged in development and management of human capital.</p>
		<p>During 8 months I was a intern and my job was to develop customer demands for specific projects using .Net 3.5, C# and Web Forms.

		<p>During the last two years the team I worked was very good and always interested in new technologies and the company was willing to start a new product that had several modules. So we had the chance to upgrade the technology and adopting new architectures and concepts. </p>
		<p>Over time we changed some internal processes to improve our development. For example, changing out version controller utilization of a bug tracker, concept of continuous integration.</p>
		<p>One of my task was to set up an open-source continuous integration server called Jenkins which brought effective gain for the team. Our deployment process decreased from 1 hour to 15 minutes and all job was done by Jenkins and not a developer.</p>
		<p>Another experience is customer service, once I was always in touch with our clients by e-mail and phone to make sure that they always have what they need and for support for technical issues or new deployments.</p>
		<p>I realized several technical visits to customers and also had the opportunity to act a bit outside the technical area. I participated in delivery meetings, planning meetings of specific features of the product, planning meetings about new way to use information in reports, new integration and classroom training about the software for different clients.</p>
