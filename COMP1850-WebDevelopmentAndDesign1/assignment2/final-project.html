		<h2>Final Project</h2>
		<div class="job-content">
			<img src="images/csgo.jpg" alt="Vitor Ubukata" width="350" class="left" />
			<p>For my Final Project I will talk about one game that I usually play during my free time, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The game expands upon the team-based action gameplay that the franchise pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago.</p>
			<p>In 1999 Counter-Strike was released as a mod for Half-Life. As Counter-Strike progressed from a beta to a full release, it refined the classic gameplay that has come to define competitive shooters and produced a dedicated community that has followed the game for over a decade.</p>
			<p>Through each of its iterations – 1.6, Source, and Global Offensive – Counter-Strike has been the de facto benchmark of a player’s skill. Teams from around the world are constantly demonstrating their ability and strategies in local, regional, and international tournaments.</p>
			<p>During the past few years eSports became more and more recognized arround the world and today we have a lot of people living with money made from the game.</p>
			<p>Also the competitive/professional scenario has grown in the past years, for example the last <a href="http://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/" target="_blank">The International of Dota2</a> game had the total prize value of $ 10,000,000 USD. But the most interesting about this prize is that one item in-game was being sold to help with the prize, so the actual players of Dota2 arround the world came together to get this 10 milions dollars for the tournament.</p>
			<p>CS:GO is getting bigger every year with more tournaments coming up, most of them happen in USA and in Europe, since most of the teams are stabilished in that places.</p>
			<p>In this page I will talk about the CS:GO and for my final project I will talk about the competitive side of Counter-Strike Global Offensive, teams, tournaments, strategies and also how CS:GO is getting more popular.</p>

			<p class="content-title">Game modes</p>
			<p>Arms Race: Arms race is a gun-progression mode featuring instant respawning and a ton of close-quarter combat. Players gain new weapons immediately after registering a kill as they work their way through each weapon in the game. Get a kill with the final weapon, a golden knife, and win the match.</p>
			<p>Demolition: In demolition mode, players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced gameplay. Players are automatically granted a starting weapon, and advance through a sequence of firearms when they register a kill. If you’re up to the challenge, you can try to register a kill each round and reach the ultimate weapons, powerful sniper rifles!</p>
			<p>Casual: Casual mode, players automatically receive body armor and defusal kits and gain bonus rewards for kills.</p>
			<p>Competitive: This is the classic gameplay that made Counter-Strike famous. Queue up and join a 5v5 best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules on one of the classic maps. You can join a match on your own, or form a team and enter a match as a unit.</p>
